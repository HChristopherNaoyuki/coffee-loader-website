# Coffee Loader

**Coffee Loader** is a fun, animated CSS loader designed to resemble a coffee machine 
brewing a fresh cup of coffee. It features animated liquid, steam, and various components 
of a coffee machine, making it an engaging visual element for web applications during load 
times or transitions.

## Demo

You can preview the animation by opening `index.html` in your browser. The loader will be centered on the screen and run continuously using CSS animations.

## Features

* Pure HTML and CSS (no dependencies)
* Animated coffee brewing effect
* Steam/smoke effects
* Modular and well-organized structure
* Optional JavaScript hook for further enhancements

## File Structure

```
coffee-loader/
├── index.html       # Main HTML file
├── style.css        # Contains all CSS styles and animations
└── script.js        # Placeholder JavaScript for future use
```

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. To integrate into your own project, copy the relevant HTML and CSS into your application.
4. Customize styles or animation timings as needed.

## Customization

You can tweak the following parts to fit your needs:

* **Colors:** Change colors in `style.css` to match your brand.
* **Animation Timing:** Adjust animation durations in `@keyframes` and `animation` properties.
* **Size and Positioning:** Update the `.container` width/height or position as needed.

## JavaScript Integration

Although this loader is purely visual and doesn’t require JavaScript, a placeholder `script.js` file is included for adding functionality later, such as:

* Displaying the loader during API requests
* Triggering the loader conditionally
* Adding interactivity

```js
console.log("Coffee loader is ready!");
```
